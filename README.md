# Ventilation System Simulator
This repository contains the ventilation system simulator based on the affinity laws with tunable exponents. 
The different components modelled in this simulator are: ventilation system (with exhaust and supply fan), 
indoor CO2 model, household loads (using BehavSim), residential buildings and demand response controller. 
For details on the model please check:

## Content
- aggregayed-behavsim-loads/: Folder containing a a CSV file per each household load generated from the BehavSim csv files using aggregated_behavsim.py
- household-loads-behavsim/: Folder containing all CSV files generated with BehavSim
- results/: Folder containing the simualtion results (configuration of the different buildings and output variables)
- aggregate_behavsim.py: Code that gets as input the CSV files generated in BehavSim and aggregates all appliances loads per households.
- simulator.py: Main simulator with all classes definition and execution of the environment.
- dr_controller_test.csv: File containing the control actions scheduled by the demand response controllers (from, to, relative pressure setpoint)
- IndoorCo2Gen24h.csv: File containing the indoor CO2 generation per each hour in Grundfos Dormiotry Lab required by the indoor CO2 model (parameter G in CO2 model)
- stable-req.txt: File containing all required Python packages to run the simulator

## Requirements
- Python 2.7
- Python libraries from stable-req.txt
- Access to BehavSim data: https://github.com/gridsim/behavsim

## How to run it
- Define simulation capitalized parameters in the constants definition in simulator.py (e.g., simulation time, number of buildings...)
- Write the scheduled control actions in dr_controller_test.csv
- Run simulator.py. This will generate 2 files: SimulationConfiguration.csv with all buildings definition and output.csv with the simulation data (time, total power, average CO2)
